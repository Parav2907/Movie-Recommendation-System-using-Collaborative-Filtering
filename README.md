# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using **Collaborative Filtering** based on user ratings. The system is built in multiple stages, starting from data preprocessing to similarity-based recommendations using the **MovieLens 100k dataset**.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is structured across four weekly notebooks:
- **Week 1**: Data loading, merging datasets, and initial preprocessing.
- **Week 2**: Feature extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and rating matrix construction.
- **Week 3**: Implementation of user-user collaborative filtering using cosine similarity.
- **Week 4**: Generating top-N movie recommendations for users and evaluating similarity.
